# Internship_Task4
## Task 4 :    Build a REST API with Flask
### Objective:  Create a REST API that manages user data.
### Tools :Python, Flask, Postman or Curl
#### Below are the points which I learned from this project

- How to set up a Flask application <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned how to install Flask, create an app.py file, and start a local development server that runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000. <br>
- How REST API routes work <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Understood that each API route (like /users or /users/<id>) is linked to a function that decides what data is sent back. <br>
- The four main HTTP methods <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned how to: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GET → fetch data from the API <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POST → send new data to the API <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUT → update existing data in the API <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DELETE → remove data from the API <br>
- Working with in-memory storage <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Used a Python dictionary to store user data temporarily without using a database. Learned that data will reset when the program restarts. <br>
- How to handle JSON data in Flask <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Practiced reading JSON input from a request and returning JSON output so that Postman or browsers can read the results. <br>
- Returning HTTP status codes <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned how to send success codes (200, 201) and error codes (400, 404) along with meaningful messages. <br>
- Testing an API with Postman and Curl <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Understood how to send requests to different endpoints, check responses, and verify that data is being updated or deleted. <br>
- Error handling in APIs <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Added conditions so the API returns a proper error message when a user doesn’t exist or when the required data is missing. <br>
